chrome-exts.github.io with a simple page to explore the data (static or not)
add tags to git to be able to link easily
nicer git interface + codesearch
first pass of analysis of trackers & co.


host .zips and .git repos on s3
setup phabricator as a repository viewer

automation:
   - sitemaps => update ext-list
   - pages crawl => update user counts
      - popcontest => update ext to download
   - crx crawl => download new crx if exist

goal: improve coverage to more than the top 10k + be careful of removed extension and new trendy ones
